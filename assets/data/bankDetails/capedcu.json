                "The CapEd Federal Credit Union is a non-profit, member-owned financial cooperative that offers financial services to a variety of member groups, but principally to education personnel. Since 1936, CapEd Federal Credit Union has been in existence. It is the fourth biggest credit union in Idaho, with assets reaching $1.09 billion and more than 90,000 members. The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), established by Congress in 1970 to guarantee member deposits in federal credit unions, insures CapEd Federal Credit Union. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) administers NCUSIF, which provides a minimum of $250,000 in insurance on credit union member deposits."
