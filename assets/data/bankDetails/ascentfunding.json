                "Ascent Funding is a private loan organisation that prioritises students by providing school loans and consumer loans for boot camps. Students, like other loan providers, can apply for an Ascent student loan that requires a cosigner. Ascent, on the other hand, offers non-cosigned loans that may be based on a student's credit or future earning potential. Ascent Funding was established in 2015 and is headquartered in San Diego. Students who are neither nationals nor permanent residents of the United States, or who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status – known as 'Dreamers' – are able to apply for Ascent private student loans."
