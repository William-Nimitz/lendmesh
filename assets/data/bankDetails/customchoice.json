                "Custom Choice's undergraduate and graduate loans have competitive APRs. Custom Choice offers the lowest maximum interest rate on both fixed rate and variable rate loans for undergraduate and graduate students, which may indicate that it is a suitable option if your credit isn't stellar. SunTrust Bank and Cognition Financial formerly collaborated to provide Custom Choice Loans. When SunTrust's student loan service was pulled out, Cognition Financial partnered with Citizens Bank to offer new loans to students in all 50 states beginning in July 2020."
