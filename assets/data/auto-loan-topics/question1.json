        "Some people are offered car loans from banks that they have accounts with. However, there are times when the borrower does not have an account with this bank. In this case, they can get an auto loan from a credit union.",
        "There are many benefits to getting an auto loan from a credit union instead of a bank. One of the most important is that they don't have to go through the same stringent loan qualification process in order for their application to be approved. This can save borrowers a lot of time and frustration since they do not need to go through the entire process again and again just because their current lender doesn't approve them for another loan."
