    "Meta_Keywords": "US Citizens student loan, student loan, international students, permanent resident student loans, education loan, best education loan",
    "Meta_Description": "This would require a major shift from how the US government currently funds higher education. College would need to become more accessible and affordable, not just through loans or scholarships, but also by providing more ways to help families afford the cost of living during their children’s time in college.",

        "The US government's policies on student loans and higher education have been changing significantly in the last few years. The Education Department has created a new \"college scorecard\" with data on the cost of tuition at various institutions, and the Senate introduced legislation to make two- and four-year public colleges and universities free.",
        "The US Senate recently released a legislation to make higher education free for all students. A new bill sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities for both domestic students and international students, estimated to cost $70 billion. The measure also changes how financial aid is given to college students by reducing interest rates on student loans, expanding work study programs, providing loan forgiveness for those who pursue careers in public service, and making community college tuition free.",
        "Unfortunately, as of 2021 college isn’t free. However, college students might be able to get a portion of their college costs paid for through financial aid, scholarships, and other programs.",
        "The cost of college tuition has been on the rise for years. To find a solution for the increasing prices, some students have been advocating for college to be free for all US citizens or international students.",
