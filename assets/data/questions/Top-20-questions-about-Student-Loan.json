                "Federal and private lenders handle missed payments differently. If you miss a federal student loan payment, you become delinquent and incur a late fee. After 90 days, the loan service reports your missed payments to the credit bureaus, which can tank your credit score. If you still haven’t paid after 270 days (about nine months), you risk defaulting on your student loan, which carries serious consequences.",
				"Private lenders are known to be even less lenient with borrowers. Missed-payment policies vary by lender but may include steeper late fees and reporting to credit bureaus sooner.",
				"If you miss a student loan payment, it is common for your loan servicer to add a late fee and report you to one or more credit bureaus. A late fee will most likely be charged to your account with each passing day that you do not make a payment and may be up to $50 or more per month based on the amount loaned. The credit bureau will then list the missed student-loan payment on your credit report, and it can affect your ability to take out future loans or get new jobs in some cases."

The best way to improve your chances is by getting your credit score as high as possible – especially for underwriters who make decisions based purely on that factor.",
