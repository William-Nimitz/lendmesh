            "question": "I am A First Time Car Buyer, Do I Need a Co-Signer?",
            "answers": [
                "If you are considering buying your first car, it is possible that you will not qualify for a car loan (if you don’t have good credit history or having new credit history) without the help of a co-signer.",
				"Co-signers are people who agree to take on the responsibility of paying the full amount owed on loans, credit cards, or other obligations if someone else misses their payments. Co-signing is basically like taking out a loan (or acting as guarantor) for another person.",
				"The first thing you should do is check your credit report for any errors. If there are any errors on your credit report, they can often be corrected by contacting the reporting agency and providing them with information on why the information is incorrect or needs to be removed. If there are no errors on your credit report, then you should start thinking about getting an affordable car loan with a low-down payment that doesn't require a co-signer. A good place to look for these loans is online banks or credit unions that have lower rates and more flexible lending requirements than traditional brick and mortar banks."

            "answers": [
                "The answer to this question is entirely up to the person considering the purchase. Some people may want to get financing first while some people may want to browse for cars first.",
                "A person should apply for car loans before they start shopping around because it takes time and there are many steps involved in both processes. Moreover, some deals can be time-bound while some deals may not last long. It is important to know whether the deals are time-bound or not before making a decision on when they should apply for car loans.",
				"It's important to keep in mind that you're not buying a car when you apply for a car loan. The dealership will sell you a vehicle based on your credit score, and the type of vehicle they have available in your price range. It's possible for it to be months before you can actually take ownership of the vehicle, so this is something to consider before applying for a loan.",
				"An application doesn't take long, and it typically takes about 10 minutes or less. This means that there is no reason to delay applying for one until after picking out your new ride from the lot!"

            "answers": [
                "Self-employed people are often considered high-risk borrowers because of the lack of a company to vouch for them.",
                "Self-employed borrowers are not always viewed as being highly reliable because they don’t have a steady income, but many lenders have started to come up with alternative solutions to help secure their loans. Lenders can use things like verifying proof of income, proof of purchase contract, credit scores, and even asking for co-signers on the loan.",

                "When a person is unable to pay their car loan, it is common for the lender to repossess the vehicle.",
				"You may be surprised by this answer, but in most cases, it is possible to get approved for another car loan after you’ve had a repossession. You’ll most likely need a co-signer or a substantial down payment but there are always options for auto loan approval, even after a repossession. For more details, speak to the dealership’s financing manager.",
				"You may be able to get financing for a car even after you’ve had one repossession. You should use this option if your situation is eligible to get approval for the loan."

                "There are 2 different kinds of auto loans. New Auto loan and used Auto loan. There will be less interest rates for the new auto loan compared to used auto loan due to the security. Sometimes there may be holiday offers / clearance offers from dealer for 0% APR loan. That works cheaper for the lenders. Because they pay only the principal amount for 5 years. Which is very convenient and works cheaper; If you see that don’t miss it.",

            "question": "Do I need a down payment?",
            "answers": [
                "You may be wondering, 'What is a down payment?' A down payment is a sum of money that you pay when you make a purchase for something. You can use your down payment to buy a car, for instance.",
                "It's also called 'a deposit,' and it means that you've put in some of the total money needed to buy the car. If you take out a loan from the bank to buy the car, they'll usually want you to put up at least 10% - 20% of their cost as a down payment before they'll give you any credit. The more down payment you make it may lower your interest because it is less risk to lenders.",
                "If you want to aim for the lowest interest rate, but if you have credit issues, you’re likely to get approved for a rate higher than that of a good credit borrower. Interest rates are largely determined by your credit score, but you can lower the amount you pay in interest charges by putting cash down on the loan.",
                "A good credit borrower may not need a down payment, but it’s always a good idea to put some cash down to help lower the interest charges. Additionally, a down payment lowers your monthly payment! Want a specific car, but not the large monthly payment? Use an auto loan calculator to determine how much you’re going to need to put down to get to the payment you want each month.",
				"Keep in mind that every lender is going to vary in their down payment requirements, and it largely depends on the amount you’re financing and your credit score."

                "The auto value of my trade-in is the amount that an investor would be willing to pay for the car. The borrower may negotiate with the lender to get more money for their trade-in.",
                "The auto value of my trade-in is also called the gross vehicle value (GVV) or wholesale price of a used car. The borrower may negotiate with the lender to get more money for their trade-in.",
				"The “trade-in” values vary depending on the condition, accident reported, types of accidents and type of car you would like to trade in. The lender will calculate the trade-in value based on the wholesale value of the vehicle. The lender will then offer a loan for your new vehicle based on that same amount, plus interest rates and other factors.",
				"You can estimate the value of your current car using online sites, although you might get less than what those sites suggest. The dealer is likely to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and probably drive it to help determine the trade value that they offer you."

            "answers": [
                "The auto loan service contract is a legal contract signed in between the car buyer and the car seller. It is also called Guarantee Service Contract, Guarantee Service Agreement or Mini-Warranty.",
                "This question is for the finance and insurance (F&I) manager at the dealership. After you’ve picked out a vehicle and secured a loan, you return to the finance department and discuss extended warranties and other products offered by the dealer.",
				"If you’re financing a used car, it may be a good idea to purchase a service contract or extended warranty. New vehicles come with a manufacturer-backed warranty, but used cars typically lose this perk over time or once they hit a certain mileage.",
				"Be sure to read the contract carefully and find out where you need to take the vehicle if something happens. Some service contracts require that the car be fixed only at the selling dealership. Used vehicle service contracts are optional, but are worth considering, depending on the car.",
				"It’s also a good idea to ask questions about any items that the F&I manager offers. Take your time, so you can learn what you’re really considering. The decision comes back to you, and what you feel you need when it comes to additional coverage.",
				"The main difference between an auto loan service contract and an extended warranty cover is that warranties cover physical aspects of a car whereas service contracts provide liability coverage for cars after their manufacturer warranty has expired."

						"New cars are likely to have significantly lower monthly payments than used cars because they carry lower interest rates and are eligible for tax deductions."
                    ]
                },
				"The purchase price will be lower for a used car, but it will need to be repaired more often. A new car will cost more up front but will hold its value better over time. A used car can also be bought without a loan through owner financing, while new cars almost always require an auto loan. The interest rates on both are comparable when calculated by APR (annual percentage rate)."
