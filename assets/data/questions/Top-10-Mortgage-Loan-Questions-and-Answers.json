                "'Mortgage' can also refer to the legal document outlining the loan terms and permitting your lender to seize the home if you don't repay the loan as agreed. In some states, this document is called a deed of trust.",

				"Many people decide to purchase a property and opt for a long-term mortgage. This type of loan does not require monthly payments and the repayment only happens in one time after a specific time period.",
				"A variable-rate loan is one in which the interest rate can vary over time, but there are ways to set up an automatic rate lock that will ensure that your interest rate does not change when you most need it. A fixed-rate loan, on the other hand, has an interest rate that is fixed for the term of the loan.",
				"Fixed-rate mortgages are usually the most common type of mortgage loan. This is because they offer a more level and predictable monthly payment. This type of mortgage loan is less risky than the other two because it doesn’t have an adjustable rate that can potentially rise with market fluctuations, and it doesn’t require any pre-payment penalties if the borrower wants to pay off their loan before its maturity date. Homeowners can generally borrow up to 80% - 97% of the home's value for this type of mortgage, but there may be down payment requirements depending on lending requirements in each region."
