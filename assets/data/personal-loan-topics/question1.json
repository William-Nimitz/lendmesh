        "Consolidating loans generally has more benefits than just paying them off. Consolidating loans can help you save money on interest and get rid of the debt faster. One loan will be established at a single, fixed rate and term and payments will be made to this new loan.",
        "The decision of whether to consolidate or pay off the loans depends on your situation and what you want to accomplish in the long run.",
        "Personal loans are not as cheap as consolidate loans. Personal loans have much higher interest rates and the loan is much smaller. The general rule of thumb is that personal loans are not as cheap or work well for consolidating credit card debt. Consolidate loan is generally more expensive, but it makes sense to take out a consolidate loan if you would like to avoid paying high interest rates over the course of many years.",
        "A personal loan is the best solution for people who want to access their money without having to worry about the debt. A personal loan usually has a lower interest rate than a credit card or other unsecured debts.",
        "Many people don't know that they can consolidate their debt by taking out a personal loan. Consolidating your debt means you take out one new, single low-interest loan to pay off all of your other debts. The result is one simple monthly payment at a much lower interest rate."
