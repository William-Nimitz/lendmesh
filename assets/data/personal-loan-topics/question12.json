		"Few private lenders charges origination fee is a one-time upfront charge that your lender subtracts from your loan to pay for administration and processing costs. It’s usually between 1% and 5%, but sometimes it’s charged as a flat-rate fee. For example, if you took out a loan for $10,000 and there was a 5% origination fee, you would only receive $9,500 and $500 would go back to your lender. It’s best to avoid origination fees if possible."
