    "Meta_Description": "A personal loan is a form of unsecured credit, where the borrower uses the item being purchased as collateral for the loan repayment. Personal loans are most used to buy expensive items such as cars, furniture or vacations. The drawback with using a personal loan is that your credit score may suffer if you default on payments or miss payments periodically. In terms of repayment terms, lenders offer anything from six months to ten years for repayment periods with some offering lower rates if you repay.",
    "content": [
        "The interest rates for personal loans can vary from 4% to 35% depending on the person's credit score and their specific financial history.",
        "The average interest rate on a personal loan is around 12-14%. When you take a personal loan, the interest is often calculated as a yearly rate. This means that they will add the interest amount to your balance every year.",
        "The best way to lower the interest on your personal loan would be by repaying it in full or making more payments throughout the year. You can also ask for a repayment plan from your lender. A repayment plan gives you higher monthly payments, but it makes it easier to pay off your debt over time.",
		"An interest rate is typically based on three things: your credit history, your income and the type of loan.",
		"Autopay reduces the likelihood that youâ€™ll make a late payment or miss a payment altogether. This is why some lenders are willing to give you a lower interest rate when you make monthly payments through autopay.",
		"Lenders will also usually list the interest rate range available for their personal loans on their websites. Again, this interest may vary based on the number of months the loan far. Please check carefully about this in the website and ask the lender before submitting the application."
