        "A lot of people want to know how much they will be able to borrow for a personal loan. If you need to borrow money for your personal needs, the amount of the loan will depend on several factors, including your credit score and security based on the asserts in hand. It's important to know how much you can borrow so that you can plan accordingly.",
		"The amount of a personal loan that you are eligible for will depend on your credit score, your age, and your income. The more variables that are in your favor, the more likely it is that you will be eligible for a larger loan amount. Most banks offer loans up to $35,000-$40,000 if all of these factors are in your favor. Again, that is dependent upon what the lender is willing to give you based on your credit history."
